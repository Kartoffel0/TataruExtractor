# Tataru Helper

A TataruHelper fork with a "Clipboard" translation engine and no auto updates.

This only exists because there was an update for TataruHelper which overwrote a fork I was using.
That fork, which was named TataruStudy, did basically the same thing this one does but it is now unavailable.

### Installation and usage

1. Download and extract the latest [release.zip](https://github.com/Kartoffel0/TataruExtractor/releases/latest).
2. Run TataruHelper.exe.
3. Add a translation window.
4. On the Translation Settings tab: Select "Clipboard" as the Translation Engine, FF language and Translate To can be set to anything as they do nothing.
5. On the Behavior tab: Untick Always On Top, not necessary but recommended as the Translation Window will only display "Copied to Clipboard \<timestamp\>: Copied Text".
